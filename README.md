# Visitor Entry Managment
This project is a Visitor Entry Management system with the end goal of intergrating with Paxton, in it's current state the CRUD & User Authentication system works. It was planned to use QR codes to check visitors in and out of the system but this would require a secondary application for that to work. That application would use a web camera rather than a QR code scanner however while I had wrote an Python program to do this I wanted to explore the option of doing this within a web application.

## Installation
Copy all files onto a server running PHP then in a browser navigate to the index.php file to see it in action.

## Demo
A live running demo of this application can be seen [here](http://mark.arklight.technology/code/entry/index.php)
